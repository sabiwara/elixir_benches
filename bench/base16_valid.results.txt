Warning: The function you are trying to benchmark is super fast, making measurements more unreliable!
This holds especially true for memory measurements or when running with hooks.

See: https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee/wiki/Benchee-Warnings#fast-execution-warning

You may disable this warning by passing print: [fast_warning: false] as configuration options.
